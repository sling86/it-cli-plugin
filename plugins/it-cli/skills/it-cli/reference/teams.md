# Teams (`teams`)

Microsoft Teams (Graph) for the logged-in user — list chats, read messages (with edits and reactions), send messages (plain text, Markdown or HTML; URLs become real links; @mentions, quote-replies, files, inline images, Adaptive Cards, importance), edit and delete your own messages, react, check your presence. Delegated-only (runs as you via `its auth login`; sending needs ChatMessage.Send, editing/reacting/deleting need Chat.ReadWrite).

> Auto-generated reference. Configure: `its teams setup`. For a command you can name, prefer live help `its teams <resource> help` (always current) — read this file to discover what exists. [Index](./index.md)

## chats

### `its teams chats`
Your Teams chats (1:1, group, meeting), newest message first. Delegated — run `its auth login` first.
Flags: `--limit` Max chats to show (0 for every chat) · `--with` Only chats that include this person (name or email, part match, case-insensitive)
```bash
its teams chats
its teams chats --limit 0
its teams chats --with mark
its teams chats messages self
```

### `its teams chats messages [chat_id]`
Read messages in one of your chats, newest first. Pass a chat ID from `its teams chats`, or --all-chats with --since to search every chat active in that window.
Flags: `--all-chats` Search every chat whose last message is inside --since (needs --since; up to 50 chats, newest first) · `--limit` Max matching messages (0 for all; default 20) · `--since` Oldest message time (ISO, local date or -7d/-24h) · `--until` Newest message time (ISO or local date/time) · `--from` Sender display-name substring
```bash
its teams chats messages 19:abc...@thread.v2
its teams chats messages --all-chats --since -2d --from mark
```

### `its teams chats images <chat_id>`
Download pasted and attached images from a chat using delegated Graph auth. Pages to the time boundary, checks image signatures and never overwrites an existing file.
Flags: `--since` Oldest message time (default -1d) · `--until` Newest message time · `--from` Sender display-name substring · `--output` Directory to write images (default current directory)
```bash
its teams chats images 19:abc...@thread.v2 --since -1d --output ./teams-images
```

### `its teams chats send <chat_id>`
Send a message to one of your chats, as you. Pass a chat ID from `its teams chats`. Delegated-only, and needs the ChatMessage.Send scope — after granting it, run `its auth login` again or the cached token still won't carry it.
Flags: `--message` Message text · `--message-file` Read the message from a UTF-8 file (use for long bodies — Windows command-line cap) · `--html` Treat the message as HTML, sent as-is. Without it, a multi-line message is converted for you: blank lines make paragraphs, '- ' lines make a bulleted list · `--mention` @mention chat members, comma-separated: email, full name or first name. Replaces '@Name' in the message, or goes at the start · `--reply-to` Reply with a quote of this message (its id from `chats messages`), like Teams' 'Reply with quote'. Your Notes chat (self) shows the quote as an empty box — Teams limitation · `--file` Attach a local file (up to 4 MB): uploaded to your OneDrive 'Microsoft Teams Chat Files' and shared read-only with the chat's members. Needs Files.ReadWrite · `--markdown` Treat the message as Markdown: # headings (h1-h3), **bold**, *italic*, ~~strike~~, `code`, ``` code blocks, [links](https://…), - and 1. lists (flat), > quotes, --- rules, | tables | · `--importance <normal|high|urgent>` Mark the message important — Teams shows a banner · `--subject` Subject line (Graph accepts it; Teams may not show it in chats) · `--card` Send an Adaptive Card from this JSON file. Buttons that open a URL work; Action.Submit does not (no bot to receive it). The message text, if any, goes above the card · `--image` Inline image(s) in the message body: a .png/.jpg/.gif path, comma-separated for several (4 MB each)
```bash
its teams chats send self --markdown --importance high --message-file update.md
its teams chats send 19:abc...@thread.v2 --card card.json --message 'Approval needed'
its teams chats send self --file evidence.pdf --message "for the file"
its teams chats send 19:abc...@thread.v2 --message "on my way"
its teams chats send 19:abc...@thread.v2 --mention enrique --message-file update.txt
its teams chats send 19:abc...@thread.v2 --reply-to 1790767448630 --message "agreed"
its teams chats send 19:abc...@thread.v2 --html --message-file note.html
```

### `its teams chats delete-message <chat_id> <message_id>`
Delete one of YOUR messages in a chat (Teams shows 'This message has been deleted'). Without --confirm, shows the message it would delete. A file the message shared stays in your OneDrive — delete that separately to remove access. Needs delegated Chat.ReadWrite.
Flags: `--confirm` Delete it
```bash
its teams chats delete-message self 1775589175306 --confirm
```

### `its teams chats edit-message <chat_id> <message_id>`
Edit one of YOUR messages (Teams then shows it as edited). Shows before and after without --confirm, then reads it back to check. Takes the same --html / --markdown / --mention / --importance as send; a file, card or image already on the message is left alone. Needs delegated Chat.ReadWrite.
Flags: `--message` New message text · `--message-file` Read the new text from a UTF-8 file · `--html` Treat the text as HTML, sent as-is · `--markdown` Treat the text as Markdown (same subset as send) · `--mention` @mention chat members, comma-separated (as on send) · `--importance <normal|high|urgent>` Change importance · `--confirm` Apply the edit
```bash
its teams chats edit-message self 1775589175306 --message "corrected text" --confirm
its teams chats edit-message 19:abc...@thread.v2 1775589175306 --markdown --message-file new.md --confirm
```

### `its teams chats react <chat_id> <message_id>`
React to a message with an emoji, as you (default 👍). Also takes like, heart, laugh, surprised, sad, angry. Teams keeps ONE reaction per person per message, so a new one replaces yours. Needs Chat.ReadWrite.
Flags: `--emoji` Emoji or name (default 👍)
```bash
its teams chats react self 1775589175306 --emoji 👍
```

### `its teams chats unreact <chat_id> <message_id>`
Take your reaction off a message. Give the same emoji you reacted with (default 👍).
Flags: `--emoji` Emoji or name (default 👍)
```bash
its teams chats unreact self 1775589175306 --emoji 👍
```

## presence

### `its teams presence get`
Your current Teams presence (availability + activity).
```bash
its teams presence
```
